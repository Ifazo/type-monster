                    <strong>localStorage:</strong>
                    <li>data stored with localStorage has no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript,
                        or clearing the Browser
                        cache / Locally Stored Data.</li>
                    <li>The storage limit is the maximum amongst the three.</li>
                    <li>The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and
                        available for all current
                        and future visits to the site.</li>
                    <li>It works on the same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.
                    </li> <br>

                    <strong>sessionStorage:</strong>
                    <li>It stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is
                        closed.</li>
                    <li>Data is never transferred to the server.</li>
                    <li>Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made
                        are saved and available
                        for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window
                        is closed, the storage is
                        deleted.</li>

                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Global Scope :</strong>
                    Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have global scope. Variables in
                    global scope can be
                    accessed from everywhere in the application.

                    When a module system is enabled itâ€™s harder to make global variables, but one can still do it. By
                    defining a variable in
                    HTML, outside any function, a global variable can be created.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope :</strong>
                    Block scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within
                    the function, but
                    are not visible outside of the function.
                    Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is separated by { and }.
                    Variables declared with let and const can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block
                    in which they are
                    defined.
