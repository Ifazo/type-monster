                    <strong>Local Storage :</strong>
                    <li>data stored with localStorage has no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript,
                        or clearing the Browser
                        cache / Locally Stored Data.</li>
                    <li>The storage limit is the maximum amongst the three.</li>
                    <li>The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and
                        available for all current
                        and future visits to the site.</li>
                    <li>It works on the same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.
                    </li> <br>

                    <strong>Session Storage :</strong>
                    <li>It stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is
                        closed.</li>
                    <li>Data is never transferred to the server.</li>
                    <li>Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made
                        are saved and available
                        for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window
                        is closed, the storage is
                        deleted.</li>

                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Global Scope :</strong>
                    Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have global scope. Variables in
                    global scope can be
                    accessed from everywhere in the application.

                    When a module system is enabled it's harder to make global variables, but one can still do it. By
                    defining a variable in
                    HTML, outside any function, a global variable can be created.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope :</strong>
                    Block scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within
                    the function, but
                    are not visible outside of the function.
                    Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is separated by { and }.
                    Variables declared with let and const can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block
                    in which they are
                    defined.

                <p class="card-text">
                    1. The call to the main function is first pushed into the stack (as a frame). Then the browser
                    pushes the first statement
                    in the main function into the stack which is console.log('A'). This statement is executed and upon
                    completion that frame
                    is popped out. Alphabet A is displayed in the console. <br>
                    2. The next statement (setTimeout() with callback exec() and 0ms wait time) is pushed into the call
                    stack and execution
                    starts. setTimeout function uses a Browser API to delay a callback to the provided function. The
                    frame (with setTimeout) <br>
                    is then popped out once the handover to browser is complete (for the timer). <br>
                    3. console.log('C') is pushed to the stack while the timer runs in the browser for the callback to
                    the exec() function. In
                    this particular case, as the delay provided was 0ms, the callback will be added to the message queue
                    as soon as the
                    browser receives it (ideally). <br>
                    4. After the execution of the last statement in the main function, the main() frame is popped out of
                    the call stack,
                    thereby making it empty. For the browser to push any message from the queue to the call stack, the
                    call stack has to be
                    empty first. That is why even though the delay provided in the setTimeout() was 0 seconds, the
                    callback to exec() has to
                    wait till the execution of all the frames in the call stack is complete. <br>
                    5. Now the callback exec() is pushed into the call stack and executed. The alphabet C is display on
                    the console. This is
                    the event loop of javascript.</p>
